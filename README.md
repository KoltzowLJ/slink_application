# Slink Application

A new Flutter project that integrates Firebase for backend functionalities and utilizes Dart for the application logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)

Make sure you've set up your Flutter development environment properly.

### Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd slink_application
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   Run this command to get all the packages listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Clean the build cache**  
   Before building, it’s a good practice to clear any cached builds:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   ```

4. **Configure Firebase**  
   Make sure Firebase is correctly set up in your project. If not done, follow the official [Firebase setup guide for Flutter](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview).  

   You’ll need to add the appropriate `google-services.json` or `GoogleService-Info.plist` to your `android/app` or `ios/Runner` directories respectively.

5. **Run the app**  
   After setting up Firebase, run the app on your device or emulator:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Useful Commands

- **Run on a specific platform**  
   To target a specific platform (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop):
   ```bash
   flutter run -d <platform>
   ```
   Example for running on Chrome:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

- **Build APK**  
   To generate a release APK for Android:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

- **Build for iOS**  
   To build for iOS (macOS required):
   ```bash
   flutter build ios
   ```

- **Run tests**  
   To run the unit and widget tests:
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

- **Analyze code**  
   To analyze your Dart code for potential issues:
   ```bash
   flutter analyze
   ```

- **Format code**  
   To format your Dart code consistently:
   ```bash
   dart format .
   ```

### Firebase Configuration

Ensure that Firebase is set up correctly. This project supports the following Firebase services:

- Authentication
- Firestore (Database)
- Cloud Functions (if any)
  
Follow the official [Firebase setup guide](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview) to ensure Firebase is properly configured for both Android and iOS.

### Folder Structure

The project follows the standard Flutter folder structure:

```
lib/
 ├── main.dart          # Entry point of the application
 └── src/               # Source code files, models, views, and controllers
```

### Resources

A few resources to help you get started:

- [Flutter Documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
- [Firebase for Flutter Docs](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview)
- [Dart Language Tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour)

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with dependencies, try:
  ```bash
  flutter pub cache repair
  ```

- If you experience performance issues or failed builds:
  ```bash
  flutter clean
  flutter pub get
  ```
